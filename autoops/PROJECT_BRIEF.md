# AutoOps Project Brief

## 📋 Title
**AutoOps: Full-Stack AI-Powered MLOps Automation Platform**

---

## 📄 Abstract (150 words)

AutoOps is a production-ready MLOps platform that combines a modern Next.js frontend with a FastAPI backend, supporting traditional ML (scikit-learn), deep learning (PyTorch), and large language models (Google Gemini). It eliminates weeks of development by providing a complete, tested solution deployable in 5 minutes at zero cost. The platform features an interactive web dashboard for ML predictions, AI chat, and text analysis, backed by a robust API with auto-generated documentation, health checks, and Prometheus metrics. Designed for developers, researchers, and businesses, AutoOps makes AI accessible through intuitive interfaces while maintaining production-grade reliability. With comprehensive documentation, one-command startup scripts, and free deployment options on Netlify and Render.com, it serves as both a learning tool and a foundation for building AI-powered applications.

## 🔄 How It Works

### Architecture
```
User Browser → Next.js Frontend → FastAPI Backend → AI Models
                (Port 3000)        (Port 8000)      (ML/DL/LLM)
```

### Request Flow
1. **User Input** → Frontend form/chat interface
2. **API Call** → TypeScript client sends JSON to backend
3. **Validation** → Pydantic validates request data
4. **Processing** → Model inference or LLM API call
5. **Response** → JSON result with metadata
6. **Display** → React components render result with animations

### Key Components
- **Frontend**: 20+ React components, responsive design, real-time updates
- **Backend**: 10+ REST endpoints, auto-generated docs, health monitoring
- **Models**: Traditional ML, PyTorch neural networks, Google Gemini LLM
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers, Kubernetes manifests, CI/CD pipelines

## 📊 End-to-End Pipelines

### 1. Model Training → Production
```
Data Prep → Training → Validation → Deployment → Serving → Monitoring
```
- Load and preprocess data
- Train model with hyperparameter tuning
- Validate performance metrics
- Deploy to models/ directory
- Serve via /api/v1/predict endpoint
- Monitor with Prometheus metrics

### 2. User Request → Response
```
User Input → Frontend → API → Backend → Model → Response → Display
```
**Timing**: ~230ms total
- User interaction: 0ms
- Frontend processing: 10ms
- Network request: 50ms
- Backend processing: 100ms
- Model inference: 5ms
- Network response: 50ms
- UI update: 10ms

### 3. LLM Chat Conversation
```
Question → Context → Gemini API → Response → History Update
```
- User sends message
- Frontend includes conversation history
- Backend formats prompt with context
- Gemini generates contextual response
- Frontend displays and updates history

### 4. Continuous Deployment
```
Code Push → CI Tests → Build → Deploy → Health Check → Live
```
**Timeline**: 10-17 minutes
- Developer pushes to GitHub
- GitHub Actions runs tests (2 min)
- Render deploys backend (5-10 min)
- Netlify deploys frontend (3-5 min)
- Automated health checks verify

### 5. Monitoring & Alerting
```
Metrics → Prometheus → Alerts → Notification → Response
```
- Application exports metrics
- Prometheus scrapes every 15s
- Alert rules evaluate conditions
- Notifications sent if thresholds exceeded
- Team investigates and resolves
